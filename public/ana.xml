         <description>Some would argue that this has been Mike Trout's worst season, but few would say he isn't the AL MVP -- and that's about as indicative of his success as there is.</description>

         <description>With three games left in the regular season, it's still mathematically possible for the Mariners to reach the playoffs, but they have barely any margin for error as they begin a three-game series Friday against the Angels at Safeco Field. Hisashi Iwakuma starts for the Mariners, while Jered Weaver takes the ball for the Angels, who can clinch home field throughout the postseason with a win.</description>

         <description>Hector Santiago bounced back with a scoreless outing, Howie Kendrick continued to produce from the cleanup spot and the Angels held on to beat the A's, 5-4, on Wednesday afternoon, taking two of three at O.co Coliseum. With the win, the Angels maintained a 2 1/2-game lead on the Orioles for the best record in the Majors and trimmed their magic number to lock up home-field advantage throughout the postseason to 2.</description>

         <description>Oakland third baseman Josh Donaldson made a nifty move at home plate to try to score from third base on a Derek Norris fly ball in the fourth inning of the Angels' 5-4 win over the A's on Wednesday, but a crew chief review confirmed the original call: out. The review was based on Rule 7.13, which defines how a catcher is allowed to position himself on a play at the plate.</description>

         <description>The Angels entered their fourth-to-last regular-season game Wednesday with 19 more wins than they had all of last year. And though a deeper bullpen, a dangerous offense and some unexpected starting-pitching contributions have had a lot to do with that, one aspect that shouldn't go overlooked in all of this is defense.</description>
